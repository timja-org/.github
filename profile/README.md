In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server. 
Built with Java, it provides over 1,800 [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to support automating virtually anything, 
so that humans can spend their time doing things machines cannot.
Our motto is "Build great things at any scale".
